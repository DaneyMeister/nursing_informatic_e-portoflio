Presenting the Data Privacy Act in our classroom session helped me understand the crucial role of data protection in nursing informatics. Our group explored how principles like transparency, consent, and data subject rights apply directly to patient care and health information handling. This activity deepened my awareness of our legal responsibilities under RA 10173 and strengthened my ability to explain complex privacy issues clearly. It also reminded me that protecting patient data is not just a legal duty but a vital ethical responsibility in nursing practice.

                    Designing a basic EMR system using Google Sheets helped me appreciate the importance of accurate and confidential digital documentation in nursing practice. By creating sections for patient registration, physical assessment, vital signs, and monitoring tools like intake/output and GCS, I saw how organized data supports safe, efficient, and continuous care. This activity also emphasized the need to uphold confidentiality protocols when handling electronic health records. Overall, it improved my understanding of how open-source digital tools can be adapted to meet clinical needs while reinforcing nursing responsibility in safeguarding patient information.
