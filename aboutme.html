            <p>
                I’m Joshe, a nursing student passionate about learning, growing, and making a meaningful difference in healthcare. I believe that nursing is not just about caring for others, it’s also about adapting, thinking critically, and finding new ways to improve the lives of patients and communities. Through my experiences in nursing education, I’ve developed an interest in technology, health systems, and patient advocacy. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and work collaboratively. As I continue my journey, I hope to become a nurse who not only serves with skill and compassion but also contributes to positive change in the field.
