                <h3>
                    Using Lewin’s Change Model in my infographic allowed me to understand how change happens in nursing informatics, especially when introducing new technologies in clinical settings. It helped me see the importance of unfreezing old practices, moving toward innovation, and refreezing new systems to improve patient care. This activity taught me how theory can guide real change in nursing practice through structured and evidence-based approaches.

                <h3>
                    Creating this infographic allowed me to reflect on how much my understanding of nursing informatics has evolved. I used to think it was mainly about using computers in healthcare, but now I understand it's about managing data, protecting patient privacy, and using digital tools to enhance clinical decisions. Exploring concepts like Electronic Health Records (EHR) and data privacy laws helped me realize how essential informatics is in delivering safe, ethical, and efficient care. This task also improved my digital literacy and challenged me to communicate my growth creatively and clearly.

                <h3>
                    Reading about the use of clinical pathways in hospitals deepened my understanding of how informatics supports quality improvement in nursing. I realized that standardized care pathways, supported by electronic systems, help reduce variation in practice, improve patient outcomes, and ensure evidence-based care. This journal showed me how informatics tools are not just documentation aids—they are essential in guiding clinical decisions and enhancing workflow efficiency. It also reinforced the role of nurses as active contributors to data-driven healthcare improvements.

                <h3>
                    This journal helped me appreciate how informatics plays a vital role in developing standardized, patient-centered education in nurse-led clinics. I learned that using data from both clinical practice and patient feedback allows nurses to design consistent and effective teaching strategies. Informatics supports this process by organizing and analyzing information, which leads to more informed, evidence-based patient education. This strengthened my understanding of how technology, research, and nursing expertise come together to improve care quality and patient outcomes.

                    Scoring 79.5 on the P.A.T.C.H. Assessment made me realize that I am developing a solid level of confidence and readiness in using technology for nursing practice. It shows that I’m becoming more comfortable with integrating digital tools in clinical settings, though there is still room to grow—especially in applying informatics in real-time decision-making. This self-assessment encouraged me to continue building my skills in data management, patient education, and technology-driven care, so I can better support safe and effective nursing practice in the future.

                <h3>
                    This activity helped me understand the importance of collaboration in developing a community-based Nursing Information System. By stepping into the roles of nurses, IT specialists, patients, and administrators, I saw how each perspective contributes to creating a system that is both functional and patient-centered. It taught me that informatics is not just a technical task but a shared responsibility that improves communication, access to care, and health outcomes in the community. This broadened my view of nursing as both a caregiving and systems-thinking profession.

                <h3>
                    Completing the “Digital Skills for Work and Life” course through self-directed learning helped me recognize the essential role of digital literacy in both professional and personal settings. It strengthened my ability to navigate online platforms, manage digital information, and communicate effectively using technology. This experience also taught me the value of self-paced learning in building confidence and independence—skills that are crucial for a future nurse working in a tech-driven healthcare environment.

                    This simulation helped me apply the correct CPR techniques with precision, especially in identifying proper hand placement and maintaining the recommended compression depth of at least 5 cm. Performing chest compressions while monitoring real-time ECG feedback allowed me to see how each movement affects cardiac perfusion. It trained me to evaluate compression rate, depth, and recoil more critically, making necessary adjustments based on visual cues. Successfully generating ECG spikes on the monitor gave me confidence that I can perform high-quality, life-saving compressions effectively in actual clinical emergencies.
